  <p>Earlier this year, Kaufland Croatia published a design competition
    for students under the slogan: 
    <a class="is-primary" href="https://www.kaufland.hr/akcije-novosti/dizajnom-za-dobre-stvari.html">
        <strong style="color: darkblue">"Students, do you think green?"</strong>.
    </a>
    The assignment was to design an environmentally friendly tote bag. There were four themes to pick from: 
    <strong>1) biodiversity</strong>, <strong>2) climate protection</strong>, <strong>3) food waste</strong>, and
    <strong>4) recycling plastic</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I chose <strong>climate protection</strong> theme, because I felt I could capture the importance of the things that affect the 
    climate in good or neutral way.
  </p>
  <p>
    After choosing the theme, the first step towards creating a solution was <strong>brainstorming</strong>.
    I wrote down everything that came to mind when thinking about climate change and climate protection. For instance, 
    renewable energy, public transportation, planting trees and similar things found a place on the paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brainstorming session put things in motion. There were couple ideas brewing in my head while I moved on to the
    next step: <strong>research</strong>. To see which direction my design should go, I asked myself these three 
    questions:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. "What kind of customers would buy the designed tote bags?"
  </p>
  <p>
    2. "What would be the best suited design for already existing Kaufland brand?" and
  </p>
  <p>
    3. "What do other supermarkets tote bags look like?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally, the research was conducted in three parts, each focused on answering the questions above.
    Most of the information about Kaufland's brand I found on their website and their social media was helpful
    in researching the customers. I also had their regular tote bags to study and nudge my design in the direction of 
    their brand.

    The third part of research focused on the competition and what could make my design equally good or, if possible, 
    better than theirs.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the thorough research, I went back to the brainstorming session notes. I felt like I have enough information
    about the brand, the customers, the competition, the standard of tote bag design and things connected to climate
    protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next step was to boost the creativity with <strong>Crazy Eights</strong>. During that exercise, I poured everything
    from my brain to a piece of paper folded three times in half in a way that formed eight little sections.
  </p>

    Some ideas were silly, some ideas were good but not optimal for the customers average age, and one idea clicked 
    like it was perfect. It was mosaic, a bit like the official tote bag, but in hexagons that are part of a honeycomb.
    Each hexagon represented an action we could take, or support, for climate protection. The color I wanted to use was 
    light green to emphasize the slogan of the competition: <strong>Think green</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For creating the design, I followed the instructions written in the competition (regarding size, colors and such).
    The tool I used for designing the solution was Adobe Illustrator.

  <p>
    "Think green" translated to Croatian is "Mislimo zeleno", but because there is a bee in the design, I used a play 
    on words and made a smaller 'z' in front of 'zeleno'. That way it looked like the bee is buzzing the slogan. To 
    make the design more suitable for their brand, I used Kaufland's font and typed the slogan in a similar way it is 
    shown on their reusable bag above. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After finishing the design I wanted to know how it would look on an actual tote bag. So I looked for mockups on
    Freepik and Unsplash, and used Adobe Photoshop to put my design on the mockups.
