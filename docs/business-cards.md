        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Project Summary</h3>
        <p>I was the sole designer on this project which required designing a business card for a Freelance Android Developer.
        The task was to create a design containing important information and to fit it on a small 2.75" x 1.10" card.

        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Research</h3>
        <p>The first step was to research popular business card designs. 
        For inspiration, I used Pinterest, Dribbble, and Behance. Then I jotted down the information 
        that needed to be on the card:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>name</li>
            <li>website</li>
            <li>email</li>
            <li>occupation</li>
            <li>google developer profile</li>
            <li>area of specialization</li>
            <li>photo</li>
            <li>personal logo</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After that, I did several brainstorming sessions on occupying as little space as possible
        with the above information.</p>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Tools applied in the project</h3>
        <p>I created the whole design in <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> and used 
        <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> for removing the background of the clientâ€™s photograph.</p>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Final Design - style guide</h3>
        <p>I used colour theory principles when choosing the colour for the cards. Due to the use of 
        orange in the logo, I chose a dark blue shade for the background to make it pop.
        The combination of the <> signs in the logo creates a <strong>Z</strong>. It has rounded corners, so the idea 
        was to create a matching rounded font for the card. For that, I drew inspiration from Roboto 
        and Open Sans fonts.</p>

        <a href="/images/font-making.png">
            <img src="/images/font-making.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="Font making.">
        </a>
        </figure>
        <figure class="is-mobile is-hidden-tablet is-hidden-desktop">
            <a href="/images/font-making.png">
                <img src="/images/font-making.png" alt="Font making">
            </a>
        </figure>
        After finishing the font design, the next step was to mark the name, email, and website parts.
        I chose to do that with square brackets. They have a cleaner look than curly ones and, in programming, 
        are also used to index (access) elements in arrays.

                <img src="/images/business-card-front.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="Front of the business card">
            </a>
        </figure>
        <figure class="is-mobile is-hidden-tablet is-hidden-desktop">

            </a>
        </figure>
        <p>Occupation, area of specialization, photo, full name, and google developer profile was left to put on the back.</p>
        <p>After removing the background, I also rounded the photo in a circle. Circles are considered perfect shapes. 
        They are also popular on social media for showing profile pictures. For the background behind the photo, I chose the same shade of dark blue. 
        Below the picture is the link that leads to the client's google developer profile.</p>
        <p>Then on the right is a larger space with a white background containing other information.
        The occupation is written in upper case, thin font. Below, equally distributed but in a bolder font, is the full name. And then, 
        in the right-bottom corner is right-aligned the area of specialization.</p>
        <figure class="is-desktop is-hidden-mobile">
            <a href="/images/business-card-back.png">
                <img src="/images/business-card-back.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="Back of the business card">
            </a>
        </figure>
        <figure class="is-mobile is-hidden-tablet is-hidden-desktop">
            <a href="/images/business-card-back.png">

            </a>
        </figure>
        <p>Arranging elements this way left both sides of the card with enough negative space. 
        In the end, that's what gave them a nice, clean look.</p>
