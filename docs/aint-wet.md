        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Roles in the project:</h3>
        <p>I worked with two other people on this project. The time limit for completing it was 
        two 90 minutes sessions.</p>
        <p>
            Everyone had the same responsibilities which consisted of:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Analysing the assigned website: <a href="https://aintwet.nyc/" target="_blank"><strong><font color="blue">Aint Wet</font></strong></a></li>
                <li>Identifying its problems</li>
                <li>Thinking of solutions for those problems</li>
                <li>Researching popular online shopping websites</li>
                <li>Wireframing: low-fidelity and high-fidelity</li>
                <li>Prototyping: connecting high-fidelity screens into a prototype.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Project Summary</h3>
        <h4 class="is-size-5-mobile">Problem:</h4>
        <p>Redesign the webshop to be more user-friendly.</p>
        <h4 class="is-size-5-mobile">Goal:</h4>
        <p>Make the website look like other standard Online Shopping Websites.</p>

        </a>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Who are the users?</h3>
        <p>The users are everyone interested in shopping for shirts, snacks, and similar products online. Most of them are probably from the United States due to the expensive international shipping.</p>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Tools used in the project:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span>
            <strong> Draw.io</strong></li>
            <li><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span> 
            <strong> Marvel</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Research</h3>
        <p>Because of the time limit, we didn’t have much time for research. Because of that, we 
        focused on just researching the market. We did that by looking at some of the popular Online Shopping Websites.
        </p>
        <h4 class="is-size-5-mobile">Key takeaways:</h4>
        <p>Many of the websites at the time followed this trend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>using black and white theme</li>
            <li>having navigation at the top of the screen</li>
            <li>having a search bar located in the middle, or the right top corner</li>
            <li>having access to the shopping cart in the top corner (next to the search bar)</li>
            <li>having filters for shopping by categories, price ranges, and such on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>having a copyright sign in the footer</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
        <p>After doing the research, we created wireframes for the new design. First, we consulted about the elements that should be identical on every page. Then each team member picked one page and designed a  wireframe for it.</p>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-home.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-home.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>Above is the wireframe that represents the home page of the redesigned website. 
        As you can see, a place for the logo is in the heading. Since the current website design 
        didn’t contain an identifiable logo, we later decided to make one. Below the heading, there 
        is a navigation bar. On the right, there are a search bar and a shopping cart.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-shop.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-shop.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>Here is the wireframe that represents the shopping page of the new design. 
        The heading and navigation bar match the previous one. The navigation bar for filtering 
        shopping by category, price range, and shipping is on the left. The buttons for adding to 
        the cart are below the pictures of the products. They are all the same size and evenly 
        distributed.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-cart.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-cart.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>The last wireframe represents the shopping cart. Below the matching heading, there is a 
        progress bar. It indicates how many steps remain until finishing the order. Items in the 
        cart contain product information such as product name, description, price, and amount. In 
        addition to the items in the shopping cart, there are also recommended products on the right
        side.</p>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Final Design - style guide </h3>
        <div class="section columns is-centered is-vcentered">
            <div class="column">
                <p>People like familiarity. The original website design, although creative, is more likely 
                to cause anxiety when shopping online.</p> 
                <p>Online shopping should be a safe place where people 
                wouldn’t need to worry about the legitimacy of the page and their credit card information 
                getting stolen. </p>
                <p>After creating the wireframes, we quickly designed a simple logo. For that, 
                we used one of many free logo-making websites at the time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <a href="/images/aint-wet-logo-rounded-corners.png">
                <figure>
                    <img src="/images/aint-wet-logo-rounded-corners.png">
                    <figcaption class="text-center" style="font-family: 'Open Sans'">Website logo</figcaption>
                </figure>
                </a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>As stated earlier, we chose to redesign the home page, the shopping page, and the shopping cart page. 
        Below are the screenshots of the before and after.</p>
        <h4 class="is-size-5-mobile">Home page</h4>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-original-home-page.gif">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-original-home-page.gif">
                <figcaption>Aint Wet Home Page</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>From the first look, there are several problems with the home page. 
        The first one is that the title doesn’t fit the heading. So instead of what, I am assuming, 
        should have been “Touch start to begin”, it reads “Touch start to beg”. The second problem 
        is that there is too little information. Even if the title was readable, the user still 
        wouldn’t know if this was an online shopping site or not. Nothing suggests that it is. The 
        third problem is that the navigation is confusing. There are also problems with responsiveness. 
        The font size is too big, and the animation of the pointing finger makes it look more like 
        a pop-up ad than an online shopping website.</p>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-home-marvel.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-home-marvel-resized-image.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>
            To solve those problems we designed the solution above. This way there is no confusion 
            about what the website is about.  The first thing user would see would be the image of 
            clothing items on sale. There is also a button that says “Shop online” which would take 
            the user to the shopping page. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="is-size-5-mobile">Shopping page</h4>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-real-site-shop.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-real-site-shop-resized.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>On this Shopping page, there are several products available for purchase. There is also 
        a button that leads to the cart and a button that says “Cancel”. The purpose of the cancel 
        button was not clear. I had to click on it to see what it does, and what it does is it takes 
        you back to the home page.</p>
        <p>There is also a problem that you can´t reach your shopping cart from any other page than 
        Shop. In conclusion, the navigation is poor and unclear. The menu in the top right corner is
        for filtering products by “Shirts” or “Snacks”. However, it just looks like the button that 
        led us to the Shop page.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-shop-marvel.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-shop-marvel-resized-image.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>We decided to fix the navigation problem by placing a standard navigation bar below the 
        heading. We also enabled access to the shopping cart from any page. We solved the problem 
        with unclear filtering by putting a left sidebar menu.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="is-size-5-mobile">Shopping Cart page</h4>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-real-site-cart.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-real-site-cart-resized.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>This page has similar problems as the pages above. The colors are too dark, and the red 
        on the cancel button makes the user want to cancel the purchase. There is also an issue with
        the impracticality of the list of chosen items. They are in the form of an equation.
        If the user wants to purchase more than two products, the equation of products causes poor 
        visibility of the chosen products. The credit card illustration saying “Please pay” has an 
        arrow pointing to the amount of money that isn’t visible properly. Our approach to solving 
        those problems is below.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/images/aint-wet-cart-marvel.png">
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/aint-wet-cart-marvel-resized-image.png">
            </figure>
        </a>
        <br>
        <p>The chosen products are in the form of a list. There is also the amount of the product 
        under the quantity. We removed the big red cancel button altogether. Instead, there is a 
        delete icon for removing unwanted items from the cart.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>After finishing the redesign, we believe the website was more user-friendly. Our designs 
        are far from perfect, but the goal was to identify the biggest problems with the original 
        page and create a solution. Therefore, our solution reached that goal.</p>

        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">What I learned from this project</h3>
        <p>This project had the purpose of teaching us time management and prioritizing issues. 
        It also taught us the importance of dividing tasks evenly.</p>
        <h3 class="is-size-4-mobile">What would be the next steps</h3>
        <p>The project ended with those three redesigned screens. However, the next logical step 
        would be redesigning the remaining pages of the website and including them in the 
        <a href="https://marvelapp.com/prototype/8353595/screen/78001360"><strong><font color="blue">
        prototype</font></strong></a>.</p>
